On the ground I lay
Motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep
Is this all a dream?
Wake me up
I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
